### Major Changes

- 66bccec: Initial release of the @nest-lab/throttler-storage-redis package

  This package was
  [initially maintained by kkoomen](https://github.com/kkoomen/nestjs-throttler-storage-redis),
  but has since been brought into the `@nest-lab/` repository for management.
  Nothing about the usage of the module has changed, other than a slight
  variation of the name.
