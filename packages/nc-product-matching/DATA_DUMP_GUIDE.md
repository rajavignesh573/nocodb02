# Data Dump Guide for nc-product-matching

This guide explains how to use the data dump script to populate your database with realistic product matching data.

## Overview

The `dump-data.js` script generates comprehensive test data for the product matching system, including:

- **Internal Products**: Your catalog products (baby gear, toys, clothing)
- **External Products**: Products from various retail sources (Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc.)
- **Product Matches**: Sample matches between internal and external products
- **Brand Synonyms**: Common brand name variations for better matching

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Database (if not already done)
```bash
npm run setup-db
```

### 2. Run Data Dump
```bash
npm run dump-data
```

## Data Characteristics

### Internal Products
- **Quantity**: 3-10 products per subcategory (varies randomly)
- **Pricing**: Realistic price ranges for each category
- **GTINs**: Unique 13-digit product identifiers
- **SKUs**: Brand-category-number format (e.g., UPP-STR-0001)

### External Products
- **Quantity**: 2-4 external products per internal product
- **Price Variations**: Based on source characteristics
- **Title Variations**: Slight modifications to simulate real-world differences
- **GTIN Matching**: 30% chance of exact GTIN match for better matching

### Product Matches
- **Quantity**: 30% of external products have matches
- **Match Status**: 70% matched, 30% not matched
- **Scores**: 0.7 to 1.0 (realistic matching scores)
- **Price Deltas**: Calculated percentage differences

## Customization

### Modifying Product Categories
Edit the `PRODUCT_CATEGORIES` object in `dump-data.js`:

```javascript
const PRODUCT_CATEGORIES = {
  'your-category': {
    'your-subcategory': {
      brands: ['Brand1', 'Brand2', 'Brand3'],
      priceRange: { min: 10, max: 100 },
      features: ['Feature1', 'Feature2', 'Feature3']
    }
  }
};
```

### Adding New Retail Sources
Add to the `RETAIL_SOURCES` array:

```javascript
{
  id: 'src-yourstore-001',
  name: 'Your Store',
  code: 'YST',
  priceAdjustment: { min: -10, max: 10 }
}
```

### Adjusting Data Volume
Modify these variables in the script:
- `numProducts`: Change the range for products per subcategory
- `numExternal`: Change the range for external products per internal
- `matchCount`: Change the percentage of products with matches

## Database Schema

The script populates these tables:

### nc_internal_products
- Your catalog products
- Contains: title, brand, category, price, GTIN, SKU, description

### nc_external_products
- Products from external sources
- Contains: title, brand, category, price, GTIN, source information

### nc_product_matches
- Matches between internal and external products
- Contains: match scores, price deltas, status (matched/not_matched)

### nc_product_match_brand_synonyms
- Brand name variations for better matching
- Contains: canonical brand names and their variations

## Expected Output

After running the script, you should see output like:

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Check your `config.js` file
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Verify database credentials

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure your database user has INSERT permissions
   - Check if tables exist (run `setup-db` first)

3. **Duplicate Key Errors**
   - The script uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to handle duplicates
   - If you want fresh data, the script clears existing data first

### Resetting Data
To completely reset and regenerate data:
```bash
npm run setup-db  # Recreates tables
npm run dump-data # Populates with new data
```

## Next Steps

After running the data dump:

1. **Start the API Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test the Product Matching**:
   - Use the frontend to browse products
   - Test the matching algorithm
   - Verify that matches are working correctly

3. **Customize for Your Needs**:
   - Modify product categories
   - Add your own brands
   - Adjust price ranges
   - Add more retail sources

## Data Quality Features

The generated data includes realistic characteristics:

- **Price Variations**: Different sources have different pricing strategies
- **Title Variations**: External products have slightly different titles
- **GTIN Matching**: Some products share GTINs for exact matching
- **Brand Synonyms**: Common brand name variations
- **Realistic Scores**: Matching scores that reflect real-world scenarios
- **Price Deltas**: Calculated percentage differences between products

This provides a comprehensive test environment for your product matching system.
